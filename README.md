# MVSEP-CDX23-Cinematic-Sound-Demixing

Model for [Sound demixing challenge 2023: Cinematic Sound Demixing Track - CDX'23](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/sound-demixing-challenge-2023). Model performs separation of music into 3 stems "dialog (speech)", "effect (sfx)", "music". Model was trained on [DnR dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/5574713).  It based on [Demucs4](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs). Test set in CDX23 contest was very different from DnR train data. So we released best models with best metrics for DnR test set. 

## Usage

```
    python inference.py --input_audio mixture1.wav mixture2.wav --output_folder ./results/
```

With this command audios with names "mixture1.wav" and "mixture2.wav" will be processed and results will be stored in `./results/` folder in WAV format.

* **Note**: for slightly better quality of results use `--high_quality` parameter. It will be ~3 times slower.

## Quality metrics

Quality were measured on [DnR test set](https://zenodo.org/record/5574713)

| Algorithm     | SDR dialog  | SDR effect  | SDR music  | SDR mean |
| ------------- |:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Demucs HT 4 (single model)   | 14.18   | 7.92    | 6.75     | 9.62     |
| Demucs HT 4 (3 checkpoints ensemble)   | 14.68   | 8.48    | 7.30     | 10.16     |

* Note 1: SDR - signal to distortion ratio. Larger is better.
* Note 2: Music stem in DnR dataset can contain vocals
